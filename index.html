        <h1>Sprinter - Lightweight Sprint Management</h1>
        <div>
            Welcome to the <a href="scrumtool.html">Sprinter</a> page! This is a tool for you to run your scrum project. It 
            can be used on your browser directly from the <a href="scrumtool.html">link</a>, and if you prefer, it may be copied
            from <a href="https://github.com/vivek-karimbil/scrumtool-2.git">Github</a>.
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div>
            So why another tool to manage a sprint development project? Excuse the lack of formality and rigour, but while sprint was
            originally supposed to be a light way for teams to deliver software, the pressures of enterprise adoption, training a
            rapidly turning over workforce as well as several other reasons have made it hard for larger teams to benefit from
            agile processes. A tool that can front the visibiity of the project to the team and to management using a simple view,
            yet can be coupled with a powerful industry strength tool when needed would help this. In addition, the variance in
            adoption of agile processes needs support without rigidity.

        <div>
            This tool does not impose workflows or checks based on a standard, rather than pernitting data to be entered when available
            and providing defaults if not evailable. It recognises that development is often an aynchronous set of activities, and so
            the tool is designed to support the practise used rather than imposing anything.

        <h2>Running the tool</h2>
        <div>
            This tool can be used <a href="scrumtool.html">directly in your browser</a>, or downloaded and run locally, as preferred.
            The data entered is saved on your computer, so there is no host connection required. The only external dependancy is on
            <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3JS</a> for rendering graphs, which would require an internet connection when used locally.
            Depending on your browser cache, even that is often not required.
        </div>

        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <div>
            This version of the tool is for usage by an individual, loading or saving data locally when required. Saving a project
            and passing the file to the next user is possible, but without out-of-the-box ability to merge such work with changes
            made elsewhere.
            The tool does not impose a workflow, which make it possible to enter data for whatever the team is doing at any time. There
            are almost no checks on data entry.
        </div>

        <h3>Data</h3>
        <div>
            A project can be saved locally and loaded from a previosly saved version. The format for the saved file is JSON - which
            makes for an extension point or interface to other tools for reporting, governance and even project management itself.
